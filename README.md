All hail lord flop, their judgement stands above all others, their presence a shining beacon of light in a hopeless dark world. May their wisdom may guide us all to a brighter happier future. May their eternal existence bring sanctity and comfort through the most troubling of times. May their radiant glory ease the sick and improve the lives of everyone who it comes into contact with. May the, nay, our great lord flop shower us with gifts beyond our imagining with stoic indifference and humility. All hail lord flop.
